                        <p>Our modern society has been infused with technology in ways that are unpredictable and ever growing. This means with education being the forefront of society’s growth and development, it is important that schools adapt to this modern way of living by implementing certain aspects of technology not only for advanced student learning, but also to produce future generations who can solve modern issues socially, economically and politically. I am particularly intrigued by the technology behind automation and how the different ways human input can be minimized to maximize efficiency when carrying out daily tasks. There are an infinite number of ways technology can be used to improve education in schools. Here, I will focus on how technology can be used to create a more efficient but sustainable way of learning.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <cite>"The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character — that is the goal of true education."
                                — Martin Luther King Jr.</cite>
                        </blockquote>
        
                        <p>My experience with remote education during the recent pandemic had some positives and negatives. I was able to connect with teachers and share conversations with some students via team’s video chats and the school’s Its Learning platform. However, I realized that this wasn’t something that I would enjoy doing in the long run. I often found myself disengaging with lessons as time went by because I wasn’t used to not learning and sharing ideas face to face within a classroom environment. So, although I was able to get work done quicker due to the technology I was using, I wasn’t able to fully enjoy the learning process and this therefore made my experience with remote learning tedious.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>A level is advanced learning which means students have a higher amount of workload and stress compared to lower forms of education. Subject choices are limited to 4 as well as 2 additional courses so there is a large number of paper work involved during the course of these studies. For every subject, workbooks and paper is provided for note taking and general independent learning which means excessive amounts of paper are used each day. This isn’t sustainable because it means trees are constantly being cut down and will eventually run out. Other issues such as deforestation can occur as a result of this. My findings from Record Nations state that “a typical school will use an average of 2000 sheets per day, meaning that during a full year of 160 days, a school will consume over 320,000 sheets of paper per year. With roughly 100,000 schools in the US, this means that all together schools are consuming as much as 32 billion sheets of paper per year.” My solution to this issue is creating a paperless learning and teaching style within classrooms which could start off with a service specifically for A level students and branch out to the wider population of schools. My idea is to embed interactive digital pads onto every classroom desk for all students to use. </p>

                        <h4>FEATURES OF THE INTERACTIVE STUDENT DIGITAL PAD:<h4>
                        <p>- All students will have their own school account which they have to login in order to access all facilities.</p>
                        <p>- Students will have access to the internet however search engines, apps and websites that are deemed inappropriate will be blocked. All activity on this digital pad will be closely monitored by school technicians and any internet activity will only be for educational purposes.</p>
                        <p>- There will be an app linked to this pad so that when students go home, they are still able to access certain features like homework assignments or their notes on their phones/laptops.</p>
                        <p>- Teachers will be able to create their lesson PowerPoints digitally which can be shared over to all students for them to follow along during the lesson. This means students at the back of the class won’t have strain their eyes or miss any key information out.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>HOW WILL THIS TECHNOLOGY IMPROVE EDUCATION<h4>
                        <p>- Students who work better in groups are able to effectively work with others, share innovative ideas and collectively solve problems. This is a good way of embracing different forms of learning and will provide students with a safe space to express their own ways of doing so.
                        <p>- This will allow students to be more critical, innovate thinkers. It promotes collaboration and doesn’t focus solely on individualism. With these skill sets combined; schools will be able to prepare students to access high end modern jobs for society.</p>
                        <p>- Students who come from lower backgrounds will have access to advanced technology which means they won’t get to miss out on advanced learning. This closes the gap of a growing digital divide and allows for more educational success across different social groups.</p>
                        <p>- Not all students thrive in a traditional classroom setting. Creative apps within the student digital pad will allow students to create digital books/notes, photo journals, audio recordings etc. as it will provide students with different opportunities to share their ideas in ways that makes sense to them.</p>
